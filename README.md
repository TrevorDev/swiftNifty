I hate waiting in line. This is the problem I have solved. I eat out a lot but I find I spend way to much time in a line to place an order or waiting for food to be made. Swift Nifty solves this problem by eliminating the need for a person to take my order. Instead I can just go to Swift Nifty, place an order and pick up my food when it's ready. The great thing is that this process can be used by pretty much any goods or service store for placing orders.

This application doesn't only benefit customers but stores as well. If widely adopted a store will be able to attract customers with this feature and get more eyes from users browse the website.  Additionally stores will be able to process requests faster and  reduce the number of employees working cashier freeing up more staff to actually create the product.

Open data has made it much easier to build an application like this. With map data I was able to show a user the exact point on a map where a store location is and with review data I can provide insight on which products are most liked.

Swift Nifty works well both well in the browser and on a mobile phone(Android Tested).

* Uses nodeJS 11.9+
